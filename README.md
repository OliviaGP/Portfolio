# Portfolio
This portfolio will showcase the various cyber security abilities I have acquired via SANs/GIAC training and formal positions held.

I will initially organize this compendium by initial detection followed by the various types of investigations. Since there is a plethora of information that could possibly be covered, I will focus my efforts on the tools leveraged and concepts behind them. The following is a brief summary of what you will expect to find within each folder:

### Detection
Firewalls, IDS, logs (system, security, application, or custom)

### Network Investigations
Tcpdump, wireshark

### Cloud Investigations
s3logparse, bucket_finder.rb

### Memory and Host Investigations
Volatility, PEcmd.exe, AppCompatCacheParser, appcompatprocessor.py,

### Logging
with the plethora of data that logging generates, I feel like it deserves its own folder. 
EvtxECmd.exe, Powershell, Velociraptor (for triaging) and ELK

### Anti-Forensics

### Timelining
